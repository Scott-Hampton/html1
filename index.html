				<h3>Joseph Alessi</h3>
	<p>Mr. Alessi teaches a <i style="color:blue">very</i> strong college program at <b style="color:red">Julliard.</b> His students conistently occupy some of the best orchestral openings in the US and worldwide. He has also been principal trombonist of the New York Philharmonic for over 30 years.</p>

		<h2>How About the Most Famous Trombone Soloist, Hailing from Sweden?</h2>

				<h3>Christian Lindberg</h3>
	<p>His rendition of the Motorbike Concerto is <em title="Quite unorthodox, really." style="color:purple">interesting.</em> He and Mr. Alessi are without a doubt the two greatest trombonists ever, outside of jazz (though Mr. Ian Bousfield might have a word in this discussion too). Arguably the only trombonist that has ever made living out of solo work exclusively, Mr. Lindberg has transitioned seamlessly into the world of conducting and composing in his later years.</p>

		<h2>Now, Who was the Most Renowned Bebop Trombonist in the 1950s?</h2>
			<img src="images/jjjohnson.jpg" alt="Mr. JJ Johnson playing" width="350" height="262.5">
				<h3>JJ Johnson</h3>
	<p>His smooth tone and style in his recordings are <b style="color:red">legendary.</b> The extent of his work made him to the Trombone world what Charlie Parker was to the Saxophone world. Many of the top trombonists today, jazz or classical, have cited recordings they heard of JJ Johnson when they were children as one of the main reasons they were inspired to play trombone.</p>
